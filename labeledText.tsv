The British Department for Education and Skills (DfES) recently launched a "Music Manifesto" campaign, with the ostensible intention of educating the next generation of British musicians. Unfortunately, they also teamed up with the music industry (EMI, and various artists) to make this popular. EMI has apparently negotiated their end well, so that children in our schools will now be indoctrinated about the illegality of downloading music.The ignorance and audacity of this got to me a little, so I wrote an open letter to the DfES about it. Unfortunately, it's pedantic, as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives. But I hope you find it useful, and perhaps feel inspired to do something similar, if or when the same thing has happened in your area.	science,technology computing

what is the reason that 50% of the HIV case in the USA are African American? Answer: sorry for the first answer that you received to your honest question... the reasons behind the infection rate really due lie in the use of condoms but not as ignorantly put by the previous poster. African American people are the least likely to have adequate health care and therefore not have knowledge of the transmission of the disease. It is also well documented that some AA men have at times engaged in high-risk sexual behavior with other HIV+ men (down-low) or with prostitutes. They then unknowingly bring the disease home to their GF/wife. There are many other factors that go into the descrepancy between the races but this seems to be the number one cause.	h,e,a,l,t,h, ,f,i,t,n,e,s,s

Can a batter be substituted in the middle of a count? Answer: Yes...if a player is injured during his at bat (ie: fouling a ball off of his body resulting in broken bones or getting a major muscle strain where he just can't swing/stand the pain)  It happened to Jermaine Dye when he was with Oakland.  They were playing the Yankees at Yankee Stadium and he fouled a ball off of his leg and shattered the bone below the knee.  Dye was carried off of the field by 2 players.  The batter who replaced him inherited his count.  I think it may have been a playoff game and El Duque was pitching (not positive about this).	sports

How does the slingshot effect (or gravity assist) work to change the orbit of a spacecraft? Answer: When a space probe passes around a planet the orbital energy of the spacecraft relative to the planet will remain constant and so from the point of view of the planet the spacecraft will not be moving any faster on the way out as it was on the way in.  But the planet orbits the sun and when one looks at the trajectory from a sun centered point of view then the momentum of the spacecraft is greater on the way out then it is on the way in.  For conservation of momentum to hold the planet must lose the same amount of momentum as the spacecraft gained.  Of course since planets are typically many orders of magnitude heavier than space probes the change in the orbit of the planet is so small that we can't detect it.	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

Flapjacks: Junk food or a good source of post exercise energy? Answer: Actually a very good choice for a post work out meal if you combine it with some good protein.Shorter chain carbohydrates are a good choice after a work out.Basically what you're getting is maltose(from whatever grain they're made from) and glucose and possibly fructose from the syrup(that includes honey if you prefer that). A post work out meal has been shown to be most effective within 15-30 minutes afterwords.This isn't just anecdotal evidence there are studies on such things.You're more likely to replace muscle and liver glycogen if you eat within this window of opportunity.That basically means that those carbs are shunted away from fat cells(adipose tissue) and the carbs stored down as glycogen(stored carbohydrate). Combining both milk and eggs with this meal with further enhance recovery as well as cause a greater secretion of growth factors(IGF1 and growth hormone) as well as testosterone.If you use protein powders than a whey protein would be best as it's quickly digested and assimilated and has the highest biological value in humans.	h,e,a,l,t,h, ,f,i,t,n,e,s,s

When I downloaded my homevideo to the computer I selected the hightest quality AVI - 12 gigs. How do I shrink? Answer: The Microsoft Movie Maker (Built into XP) can probably get that down to size for you.  But a file that large will take a lot of time to compress to another type of file.  But to actually burn it to a DVD and watch it on a normal DVD Player (not PC in other words) You'll have to use a different piece of software.  I use Roxio's Easy Media Creator Home myself.  But if you do some searches on Google or Yahoo you might find something to your liking.  As for how to actuall acomplish your task with Roxio or Movie Maker.. you'll just have to read the tutorials in Movie Maker or the Manual of Roxio or whatever software you choose.	t,e,c,h,n,o,l,o,g,y, ,a,n,d, ,c,o,m,p,u,t,i,n,g

how come in my all black tribal tattoo there is spots that look more colored than others like spotty whitearea Answer: Hey. Im a tattoo artist so this is a pretty easy answer. As you where being tattooed you may have noticed how you where a mess with tattoo ink. Sometimes when being tattooed the ink sticks to the skin and keeps the tattoo artist from seeing that its not tattooed in the skin but just stuck on the outside. It can also be just the way you healed. Black ink is tricky and harded to see then lighter colors. Thats why when tattoo artist's are starting out they should do a lot of blackwork. If you can color in black then you can color in anything. Almost all studios offer free touch-ups within a year of your tattoo. Black also fades easy to so SUNBLOCK SPF 30 for the summers and tanning beds.   www.studiomaxx.com	b,u,s,i,n,e,s,s

pat/nat translations? Answer: There is a common misconception about PAT and NAT.  PAT This is a many to one solution. In this situation you have multiple machines talking to one firewall and then the firewall talks to the destination machine with your information but with the firewall as the return address. The firewall then receives the information the passes it on to you with the received IP being the orginal distant end.  NAT With NAT you need to have multiple ARIN routable IPs assigned to the public side of the firewall. This allows your private IPs to pick up a public firewall IP and hold on to it when talking. This is what many companies do to protect their webservers. When they have multiple inside webservers with multiple inside IPs they program the firewall to point one outside IP to a specific inside IP.  Most home routers from linksys and dlink use PAT but they just call it NAT since this is how everyone knows it.	t,e,c,h,n,o,l,o,g,y, ,a,n,d, ,c,o,m,p,u,t,i,n,g

i want to hear your opinions on heaven and hell whether you think its true or false? Answer: It will not be like most people believe. I think that many will be surprised to say the least.

(REGRETS) Heaven will be a place of rest and continued learning. I lost my daughter and the pain of not having her in my life is horrible. I can't imagine spending eternity without her. See I know that with death I will see her again. The pain that I endure now will end with my death if I live the way I should and apply the atoning power of Jesus Christ into my life I can be forgiven and be with her and God again. To me that is what hell will be like. Being separated from all the ones we care about. and never at that point being able to change it.	s,o,c,i,e,t,y

Is a roth a good way to save for a child's college? Answer: The Roth is another good choice for college education. It gives you a bit more flexibility if your child does not go to college or if he or she gets a scholarship. The only downside to using a roth is losing the tax advantages. You will have to pay ordinary imcome tax on any earnings. I would recommend using the roth exclusively until you can at least max it out. When you get to that point use the 529. I am an advisor and even the wholesalers that come to talk recommend the roth over the 529 if you cant fund it significantly.  extra info:  The Roth was created for retirment planning however it does offer penalty free withdrawals for qualified education expenses. Investments will grow tax deferred just like 529 but will be taxable when withdrawn if used for school.	b,u,s,i,n,e,s,s

Do you really think that if there were a massive deportation? Answer: No--we will never see that money again. And we will pay more.  BUT--we will not continue with the raising costs of supporting people who are not contributing their full share-and that is a BIG savings.  We need  law and order-not chaos.  And right now we do have chaos.  States have deficients they can not pay-that are climbing. And one of the big reasons (that we can control) in a mass coming here illegally.  There has to be a better more Orderly way than breaking the law to be here. If you break laws with full knowledge that you were in the wrong don't complain because of consequences. The choices were yours-rather you like the rules or not.  My choice would be (if given to me);  Protect the border first and stop adding to the problems. Hold employers accountable.  Than work on the rest.  Add On--I was helping a friend and saw a post I'm as good to a person as people are to me   I will remember that. Here on this matter of deportation  and on others.	l,a,w, ,g,o,v,t, ,p,o,l,i,t,i,c,s

PLS suggest projects  I can use for my MENG (Electrical) thesis. on power generation or Electrical control? Answer: I am too old to recognise PLS or MEG but power generating or electrical control I do. If we take Om's suggestion about a clean generator first. I am not being pedantic since we are dealing with specific terms So let's ignore the wording and assume Om means the Prime Mover of the generator. Since being green is suddenly fashionable I guess a thesis on how to make the prime mover green would be good.  There is no harm in using carbon fuels if we cleanse the products of combustion and it is only profit that has prevented it anyway. Centrifuges for separating solids or magnetism for micron size particles have been around for decades. This is without wet washers and chemical conversion of almost anything. If we wanted with the aid of carbon absorbing chemicals we could add in a little oxygen and breathe in the exhausts. For electrical control the sky is also the limit. Increase the cable size and halve or eliminate energy losses to ground. Currently we can light up a thousand tubes between pylons just by sticking one end in the ground. Fifteen percent is wasted generating Watt less Current that is unusable because of Power Factor control. Improve transmission transformers and save more by standardising their Vector Group References. Balance the Phase distribution instead of estimating without attenuation. We haven't touch the consumer part yet where copper is scantily used for profit and Amp squared Resistance losses are enormous.  There are a hundred thesis's here.	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

Physics Question? Answer: Fweigh=mg Fweigh= 20kg(9.8) Fweigh= 196N Fnormal is also 196N  Friction= mu(Fnormal) Friction= (.3)(196N) Friction= 58.8N  Everytime you see the word constant speed or motionless that mean all the forces are balanced. So the Friction=horizonal force so 58.8 is the horizonal force that keep the object moving at a constant speed.  we have to find acceleration. a=Fnet/m  Ffriction is the Fnet because the horizonal force is romoved a=Friction/m a= 58.8N/20kg a= 2.94m/s^2 (should be -2.94m/s^2 because it is slowing down)  Vf^2=2ad+Vi^2 (0m/s)^2=2(-2.94m/s^2)d+(4m/s)^2 -16m^2/s^2= (-5.88m/s^2)d d= 2.72m	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

How can I tell if caregiving is putting too much stress on me? Answer: I have been a caregiver for 16 years...the things I have noticed when I get too stressed are...loss of appetite..insomnia...mood swings..things of that nature.  I just attended a seminar on death and dying and they said that one of the things that we need to do is to take care of ourselves...even though that is something most people that are taking care of others dont do.  You will be much more capable of helping others if you take care of yourself. They said to do something that you enjoy at least once a week...even if it just soaking in a bubble bath for half an hour and reading...just some little thing that you like to do.  If you are caring for a family member you may have to enlist some outside help for that...it may be worth the money to call a local agency on aging to see if they have anyone that will come in and take over for a few hours every week.  They are usually fairly inexpensive and even just a few hours away will help you out. If you are working in a nursing home or hospital maybe request a day off and just sleep late...go shopping...catch a movie...whatever you need to do to have a little break.  Good luck to you!	h,e,a,l,t,h, ,f,i,t,n,e,s,s

In fact the Cuban-Americans make up a good chunk of the most grateful Latinos in the whole U.S.A.  My issue is with the illegal aliens who have absolutely no regard for the law at all and they really make legal aliens from their own kind look really bad.  Cause seriously legal immigrants from Mexico worked a lot harder to get into America than the illegal immigrants from Mexico.  Not to mention legal aliens usually want to learn English (and a lot of them do take the initiative to learn English before they come here so they can adapt easily to American life) but the illegals usually do not want to learn English at all.	l,a,w, ,g,o,v,t, ,p,o,l,i,t,i,c,s

what kind of maths project should i make for class x which includes science also? Answer: some suggestions: 1. You could do your own poll (among your neighbours or even on yahoo answers) and see how your results can be extended to a general population. This is what pollsters do for example to come up with projections in an election. You can find good references for doing the mathematical studies for such a project easily on the net.  2. You can study the evolutionary patterns of human beings - National geographic has a genographics project where they are collecting blood samples from around the world and mapping the journey of our ancestors. You could get your own journey mapped (by providing your cheek swab samples and $100) and then find out about other historical happenings through the ages and correlate the findings. This is a costly project so do your survey first before investing the $100 into the project.  3. Study traffic patterns on some major road and correlate that with other events going on in your city. Then make predictions for the following week and see how your model compares with the actual traffic. If you are good at programming build a small software for doing this.	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

How long must I stay married to a US citizen to get my green card? Answer: You can apply for a green card as soon as you're legally married to a US citizen.  It can take anywhere from a couple months to a couple years to get approved depending on your location and the circumstances.  Once you get your green card you're a conditional permanent resident but not a US citizen.  You have to apply two years later for non-conditional permanent residency.  At any point during this process you can be revoked if you're no longer married.  You generally are not subject to revocation if you are the victim of spousal abuse.  US citizenship is separate and you can generally apply after seven years of legal residency.	l,a,w, ,g,o,v,t, ,p,o,l,i,t,i,c,s

Working 90 hours a week is a problem so have a nice dinner ready at home if you have to and take time to get to know each other.  Don't sweat the small stuff.. and don't sweat the big stuff.. life is too short.  Work on being friends first and the rest will follow.  And don't focus on the negative with him all the time even if he does with you.  Teach by example not nagging as we woman are prone to do. Hold you tongue more often than you let it go. You'll be surprised by the result.	f,a,m,i,l,y, ,p,a,r,e,n,t,i,n,g

At the Disco Ring the Alarm - Beyonce Here It Goes Again - OK Go Is It Any Wonder - Keane Hide and Seek - Imogen Heap Mushaboom - Feist Black Horse and the Cheery Tree/ Suddenly I See- KT Tunstall Put Your Record On - Corinne Bailey Rae  Well hope that helps.

You could also watch the music videos on youtube.com which will give you the whole song.	a,r,t,s, ,e,n,t,e,r,t,a,i,n,m,e,n,t

Do jobs accept online degrees? Answer: Any degrees offered through accredited institutions of higher education are likely to be accepted as valid. There are standards that each school must meet to be accredited and employers look for this when choosing whether to hire someone based on the degrees they have. Degrees obtained from schools which are not accredited whether online or not are not likely to be accepted by employers. If you are looking into pursuing a degree online make sure you check out what kind of accreditations the school has. I have included a two good sources to reference in choosing schools that offer online degrees. Check them out.  Also if an employer isn't willing to accept your degree provide him with the schools accreditation. He may be afraid to take a risk but if he sees that the school is legit and accredited he too will be more likely to take that risk and to accept your degree as valid.	e,d,u,c,a,t,i,o,n

What is folding and faulting? Answer: Well there are these things called tectonic plates in the earth's crust. They are constantly being moved by the magma in the mantle. Sometimes two of these plates collide. Now the two plates can do one of three things: 1) create faults : faults are when the two plates are grinding past each other in opposite directions. Sometimes the tension there can cause earthquakes.(San Andreas Fault)  2)Fold: when the two plates are moving toward each other and are the same weight they fold upwards and create ridges like mountains (Himalayan mts)  3) subduction: if one of the two plates is less weight than the other the one with the lesser weight sinks below the other and eventually melts into magma.

I just bought a new computer...how do I transfer the data and programs from my old one? Answer: I am assuming that you are using Windows XP (with out without the service packs) The best way is to use the Windows File and Settings transfer wizard.  Find this under Start->All Programs->Accessories->System tools->Files and Settings Transfer Wizard.  This will help you to transfer your files and most of the windows settings.  However you will have to reinstall most of the programs seperately in the new computer.  Follow these steps 1. Run the wizard in your old computer.  If you can get a parallel cable to connect your old computer to the new one then choose that option.  Otherwise save the settings in a folder in your hard disk  2. Open your old computer case and remove your hard disk.  Now open the case of your old computer and connect the hard disk to the new one.  3.  Start the new computer and run the tool again.	t,e,c,h,n,o,l,o,g,y, ,a,n,d, ,c,o,m,p,u,t,i,n,g

my friend in the navy says he's doing his  Qualification board on Sunday to get my Dolphins what's that mean? Answer: Both Chief of nothing and navyav8r are correct. The review board is one of the hardest parts of the qualification process. the questions can be as simple as drawing a diagram to telling the members hpw to take a molecule of water from the ocean and breath it in as air. The board usually lasts several hours but I have seen a few that lasted days. If he fails than he will be allowed to reboard after studying things that he really messed up on. Something that navyav8r was not correct about is that on this board the members do not review the comments made by the boardees supervisors. Once he passes the board he will be qualified submarines which is a great honor and should instill a large amount of pride in his accomplishment. STS2/SS Kris	l,a,w, ,g,o,v,t, ,p,o,l,i,t,i,c,s

what are some good and current r&b/slow songs to put on a cd to set the mood with my boyfriend? Answer: I love Al Green's Let's Stay Together.  Anything by Barry White is also a must have.  Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton but it may be better from a guy to a girl.    In my opinion you should talk to him (or have someone else talk to him) and find out what he likes.    People here could give you all sorts of recommendations and when he listens to it he could think it's silly.  The CD is for him (and you) it should be the stuff you like and not what people here think is popular.  Last but not least... make sure you don't make the CD too sleepy... too many romantic songs that sound the same could do that to you!

Since all masses in Universe rotate isnt linear momentum equivalent to angular? Answer: First of all linear and angular momentum are two different things altogether.It doesn't follows from what you have said that linear momentum = angular momentum. In any case you will always have to multiply the linear momentum by 'r'  to get the angular momentum.  Momentum = m*v Energy /distance   * time = Force * distance /distance  * time =Force * time=mass * acc  * time = mass* velocity  So  you are correct dimensionally  Energy* Space * time=energy *distance * time =Force * distance* distance *time =mass* vel *distance^2  so this isn't momentum  Curvature of space time will have units of 1/(space time)  Find out yourselves whether next two are correct   Curvature of gravitational mass ?? You probably mean curvature caused by mass. I am not sure of this part though .In any case curvature will have units of (1/space time)   Just remember Conservation of energy follows from isotropy of time  Conservation of momentum follows from isotropy of space	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

ok i can't do this for some reason.  How do u factor this 4x^2-36x+81??? Answer: This is pretty simple   4x^2 = (2x)^2 81 = 9^2 is -36x = -2(2x)9 yes  so we get((2x)^2-2(2x)9+9^2) = (2x-9)^2  Another way try to sqaure it by putrting 81 = a + b so that   4x^2-36x+a is a perfect square (2x)^2-2(2x)9 + +9^2 is a perfect square  so a =81 and b =0  we get(2x-9)^2  1st method works when we know the pattern and second method for all cases. whole square falls into it	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

Since these are independantly assorting traits the chance that the child will have both dark hair and blood type A is 1/4 (becuase you have to use the product rule).  There is a 1/2 chance that the child will have blood type B and a 1/2 chance that the child wil have light hair.

Can i get good jop with MCSE and where ?am arabic and live in lebanon? Answer: First thing I would like to say should get good practical knowledge of remote administration for WEB Server if you intended to work from Lebanon.  Post your resume on internet and provide you can administer WEB server remotely. It would be hard as you will fresher but that is you have to prove that you can do.  Second options do find job in Lebanon it self with LAN management which is good for experience. Even bigger LAN management is challenging job.  Getting job with MCSE is not Q but is there job around in local market or international market. If you have I.Q for programming (It is not I.Q but urge to make programs) then it can be clubbed with networking that can pay really well.   Passing MCSE through dumps can lead you nowhere well Passing that could make you eligible but that wouldn’t teach you much it is all you have to decide.  Linux is another good option and there are business who wants free software to deployed in there networks. Only issue lack of trained Linux engineer and programmer for there in built requirements.   Hope you can decide on it.	t,e,c,h,n,o,l,o,g,y, ,a,n,d, ,c,o,m,p,u,t,i,n,g

how do you know if a person asked for divorce in the US? Answer: If a person has been named in a divorce filing then that person would be served by an officer of the court with papers advising them of the pending divorce suit. It is possible that the person named in the divorce to be served is not locatable in which case they may have never been served with these papers. In such a case the courts would use a locator service to attempt to find and serve this person with the legal documents. If a person believes there is a filing for divorce pending against them but has not received notification then you may contact the clerk of courts in your county to inquire as to if this is true or not.  Below is a link to the State of Texas which will provide a means for requesting status of both marriages and divorces if they have already been approved by the courts and have been finalized.   http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/reqproc/faq/mardiv.shtm#a2   Good Luck!!	f,a,m,i,l,y, ,p,a,r,e,n,t,i,n,g

Also if you see another cruiser beside the one trying to pull you over then pull over then.	l,a,w, ,g,o,v,t, ,p,o,l,i,t,i,c,s

That theory works as far as our gene pool will allow it to. There are millions of possible combinations within our gene pool; at any given time those genes which best allow individuals to survive and prosper will emerge. But that is change within our genetic structure not evolution. The reason men do not evolve is that we cannot create new DNA or new and different genes and they do not occur by chance.	s,o,c,i,e,t,y

why is the normal rate of breathing of the people is decreasing when growing old? Answer: Respiratory rate is in part controlled by the person's overall metabolic rate.  All of the body metabolic processes impact each other.  Breathing can and does change if you body becomes acidic or basic.  Both breathing and metabolism slow with age as the body goes through normal changes. This is the same reason that a 20 year old can eat 3500 Calories of food and not gain weight.  The same person at age 45 would likely have a slower metabolism and if they could eat that much would likely gain a lot of weight.	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

How can I get my 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb? Answer: Just wait it out - she is most likely doing it only in situations where she needs to feel 'more comforted' - perhaps you can address while she feels like that.  It's also very commonly used as a sleep aid at that age - if she's only doing it when going to sleep - I still would not worry about it at this age. Let them grow up on their own terms as much as you can.  People are 'forcing' the development of their children ever earlier and earlier these days - it's sad to see.	h,e,a,l,t,h, ,f,i,t,n,e,s,s

do we need out gall bladder? what are the negatives in having it removed? Answer: I had mine out a couple of years ago. I didn't have a choice on it. My condition was a life or death situation. Please take this into consideration when making that decision: My gall bladder was so severely inflamed it infected my liver and pancreas which left me with pancreatitis. So far my liver seems to have recovered ok. I was incorrectly diagnosed twice before I ended up in the emergency room near death.   The negative for having it removed is that you have to watch your diet. There are many things that we are not supposed to eat.   The big positive is vacation from school or work!!!  What ever you choose good luck.	h,e,a,l,t,h, ,f,i,t,n,e,s,s

What kind of credit card in America is the best deal to get right now for a college student? Answer: If you HAVE to get one it's ALWAYS better to get one from your local bank or credit union.  Why?  Because they are out to win your business thereby building theirs.  Choosing a random credit card company is usually a bad idea.  And if you take only one piece of advice from me let it be this....STAY AWAY from those credit card companies who send representative to your school.  They are predators and you will regret ever dealing with them.  These reps don't care about whether you get a card or not or if the company will treat you fairly.  They get paid a fee for every complete application filled out and faxed in.  Good Luck!!!	s,o,c,i,e,t,y

How do you get 6 pack abs? Please tell me specific execises and how to do them in what quantity.? Answer: Your diet is the main thing. to get to your abs you need the fat off of them. eat low fat foods and do at least a half hour of cardio a day to burn fat. after that different excercises target different areas. the best excercise i've found to work your whole abdominal area is to get a large excercise ball and get in push-up position with your ankles on the ball. pull your legs up to your chest and stretch back to push-up position. you will have to work up to higher repititions as you go because it will hurt you at first. work up to five sets of twenty five reps. leg throws are also really good. lay on your back and have somebody stand at your feet. raise your legs up to the other persons waist or chest and have them throw them back down. you have to raise your legs back up without letting them touch the floor. work up to five sets of twenty five with those also	h,e,a,l,t,h, ,f,i,t,n,e,s,s

what is defect tracting tools and how they are used in software testing? Answer: A bugtracker is a ticket tracking system that is designed especially to manage problems (software bugs) with computer programs.  Typically bug tracking software allows the user to quickly enter bugs and search on them. In addition some allow users to specify a workflow for a bug that automates a bug's lifecycle.  Most bug tracking software allows the administrator of the system to configure what fields are included on a bug.  Having a bug tracking solution is critical for most systems. Without a good bug tracking solution bugs will eventually get lost or poorly prioritized.

How do I hook up my work Outlook email to work from my computer? Answer: If your work email has email forwarding then you can just go to the options or preference on your work email and set it up so that you can forward a copy of the emails to your home email address. Then you just need to setup outlook for your home email address that you want the emails to get forwarded to. I am thinking your web based email has its own server so you cant configure it at home since Im sure there is a security firewall involved. But you can do email forwarding.  Do you know what email provider you are using for work and if they allow you to use pop and smtp to receive and send email from a different email client?

What is difference between circuit breaker and contactor? Answer: Most circuit breakers are thermal devices that when excess current run through them they heat up and trip (open up). They can also be used as a switch to open a circuit.  A contactor is a electric relay that is essentially a solenoid and a pair of electrical contacts. The solenoid is activated and it closes the contacts. They are typically used to permit a low voltage circuit or small switch to activate the solenoid so the much larger switch in the form of the contacts can close a higher voltage or higher amperage circuit.

how does the sporophytes reproduce? Answer: Sporophytes are interesting in that the organisms that contain this phase have multi generations of cells.  The sporophyte is created through the union of a male and female gametophyte.  The sporophyte is thus a diploid state in terms of chromosomes.   The sporophyte then divides into another form. The name of this form depends on the organism.  For instance mosses and such have protonemas that eventually develop into gametophores.   Protozoa such as the organism that causes malaria become mesophytes.  These forms can continue to make more of themselves (another mesophyte in the case of malaria) or differentiate into gametophytes.   This takes the circle back to where we started.  Hope that helps.	s,c,i,e,n,c,e

How can i extend what's on my laptop to my monitor? Ive a DELL LatitudeD600 w/ ATI 9000 vid card also.? Answer: If you have an RGB port on the back you and share your desktop with an external monitor (mirrioring the desktop on both).  However if you need to extend (have your desktop use both monitors as one deskotp environment) with a laptop then you have to invest in an external box.  However your cipset might (and I emphasise might) be able to support dual monitor sharing.  Plug an external monitor into the port on the back and go to Display Properties and see if you have the option there to extend Desktop.  If  you  do then the chipset supports it.  If not you can use a hardware solution like this (http://www.matrox.com/graphics/offhome/dh2go/home.cfm)  Hope that helps.	t,e,c,h,n,o,l,o,g,y, ,a,n,d, ,c,o,m,p,u,t,i,n,g

what is the most embarrassing thing you have ever done??? Answer: When I was about 5 I begged and pleaded with my uncle to drive his go-cart around in this parking lot. I told him that I knew I could handle it..  He said this is the gas and this is the brake. Do not hit them at the same time.  First thing I do (with my cousin Brian hanging on the side) is jam them as hard and as far as I can go. Now the thing is JAMMING around the parking lot at full speed with no ability to stop.  My grandpa stood in front of me for a second with his hands out like he could magically make me stop. Totally hilarious.  My poor cousin Brian's knee was totally bouncing on the ground so he tore the heck out of his new courderoy pants and tore up his knee.  My sister described the sound of my voice as AAAAAAAAaaaa hhhhh..   As I got further away I sounded less loud.  I almost hit a telephone pole..  Finally I stalled it out in this field with melons in it.. Sheesh... what a goof.  I'm amazed that I didn't take my poor grandfather out.	a,r,t,s, ,e,n,t,e,r,t,a,i,n,m,e,n,t
